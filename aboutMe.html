      <h2>About Me</h2>
      
      
      <div class="column">
        <p>My name is Florian Weber and I am studying in my eighth semester "Mobile Medien" at the HdM.</p>
        
        <p>Developed a interactive, computer animated application for
        autostereoscopic and multilayer 3D displays. The idea was to
        compare the LG P920 Optimus 3D, with a self developed approach
        to 3D. Therefore we build a device, which had three OLED displays
        put behind each other, each connected to his own SDCard. Then I
        opened a serial port to transfer data to each of the displays,
        creating the illusion of a 3D room. The application was a great
        success but could not compare on a practical level with the
        LGSmartphone. The application is developed in Java.</p>
        
        <p>During my studies I took part in an project called “Gravity³”, where
        more then 50 bachelor and master students from different study
        fields came together to develop an Oculus Rift game. Besides
        developing the game, the main idea was that the students have to
        organize everything. We created teams for music, graphics,
        management, advertising, coding, game design and QA tester. A
        small preview can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?
        v=Hc1L6sJ5HKI. We used the CryEngine and I was developing the
        core mechanics like movement and gravity change in c++.</p>
        
        <p>GroupSceen is a Website / App and allows the user to create a
        themed based virtual room where other users can join in. These
        themes can be music, documents or videos. Once created the
        room on your host PC, you can access this room from every device.
        For example inside of the music room, the creator and owner of
        the room creates a play-list, which can be filled from different
        integrated APIs like Spotify, Soundcloud or Youtube. This play-list
        can then be edited per phone or browser. The application is
        developed in AngularJS, Ionic, Firebase, Node.JS and Socket.IO.</p>
